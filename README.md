## What 🎯
This site is a demo (and testing laboratory) for [MkDocs Material Theme](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material), the popular, python-based static site builder.  

## How To 📋
- Run locally
- Deploy options - Github, Cloudflare, Vercel

### My Enhancements ⚙️
I hacked around to make MkDocs more compatible with Obsidian & create some fun themes that resemble famous documentation. 

- MkDocs for Obsidian
- Famous CSS for MkDocs

## Premium 💼
Mostly testing multi-user. 

## Standard Features 📦
- Blog
- Top bar





This site is powered by & configured to visually and functionally work well with [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/), the popular note taking app. 

If working in Obsidian or any markdown notes app, it's best to have the flexibility to place markdown files in the root directory, or anywhere you wish, and this configuration allows for this, bypassing the normal need to place files in the `/docs/` directory, among a handful of other features summarized below. 
##  🎛️ 
#### Hidden Config Folder 
Moves all config files to a hidden .mkdocs directory so not visible in Obsidian
## 🎨 
#### Custom CSS
Adds a custom.css file that mirrors default Obsidian theme. 
#### Logo and Favicons
Adds Obsidian logo and favicon for fun!
## 🧩
#### SameDir  
Allows for markdown docs to live in the root directory instead of "/docs/" which makes it much nice when integrating many git repos into one vault -- just the ability to keep any folder structure desired. 
#### Roamlinks 
This plugin allows for wikilinks support ... presumably it scans the entire directory for the filename and then gets the full path and inserts it as in normal markdown and required for a normal website.
